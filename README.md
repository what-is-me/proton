Timeplus Proton is a stream processing engine and database. It is a fast and lightweight alternative to ksqlDB or Apache Flink, 🚀 powered by the libraries and engines in ClickHouse. It enables developers to solve streaming data processing, multi-stream JOINs, sophisticated incremental materialized views, routing and analytics challenges from Apache Kafka, Redpanda and more sources, and send aggregated data to the downstream streaming or database systems. Timeplus Proton is the core engine of [Timeplus Enterprise](https://timeplus.com).

## 💪 Why use Timeplus Proton?

1. **[Apache Flink](https://github.com/apache/flink) or [ksqlDB](https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql) alternative.** Timeplus Proton provides powerful stream processing functionalities, such as streaming ETL, tumble/hop/session windows, watermarks, incremental materialized views maintenance, CDC and data revision processing. In contrast to pure stream processors, it also stores queryable analytical/row based materialized views within Proton itself for use in analytics dashboards and applications.
2. **Fast.** Timeplus Proton is written in C++, with optimized performance through SIMD. [For example](https://www.timeplus.com/post/scary-fast), on an Apple MacBookPro with M2 Max, Timeplus Proton can deliver 90 million EPS, 4 millisecond end-to-end latency, and high cardinality aggregation with 1 million unique keys.
3. **Lightweight.** Timeplus Proton is a single binary (\<500MB). No JVM or any other dependencies. You can also run it with Docker, or on an AWS t2.nano instance (1 vCPU and 0.5 GiB memory).
4. **Powered by the fast, resource efficient and mature [ClickHouse](https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse).** Timeplus Proton extends the historical data, storage, and computing functionality of ClickHouse with stream processing. Thousands of SQL functions are available in Timeplus Proton. Billions of rows are queried in milliseconds.
5. **Best streaming SQL engine for [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) or [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com/).** Query the live data in Kafka or other compatible streaming data platforms, with [external streams](https://docs.timeplus.com/proton-kafka).

![Proton Architecture](design/proton-architecture.webp)
See our [architecture](https://docs.timeplus.com/proton-architecture) doc for technical details and our [FAQ](https://docs.timeplus.com/proton-faq) for more information.

## How is it different from ClickHouse?

ClickHouse is an extremely performant Data Warehouse built for fast analytical queries on large amounts of data. While it does support ingesting data from streaming sources such as Apache Kafka, it is itself not a stream processing engine which can transform and join streaming event data based on time-based semantics to detect patterns that need to be acted upon as soon as it happens. ClickHouse also has incremental materialized view capability but is limited to creating materialized view off of ingestion of blocks to a single table. Proton uses ClickHouse as a table store engine inside of each stream (alongside a Write Ahead Log and other data structures) and uses to unify real-time and historical data together to detect signals in the data. In addition, Proton can act as an advanced data pre-processor for ClickHouse (and similar systems) where the bulk of the data preparation and batching is done ahead of ingestion. See [Timeplus and ClickHouse](https://www.timeplus.com/timeplus-and-clickhouse) for more details on this.

## ⚡ Deployment

### A single binary:

```shell
curl https://install.timeplus.com/oss | sh
```
Once the `proton` binary is available, you can run `proton server` to start the server and put the config/logs/data in the current folder `proton-data`. Then use `proton client` in the other terminal to start the SQL client.

For Mac users, you can also use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to manage the install/upgrade/uninstall:

```shell
brew install timeplus-io/timeplus/proton
```

### Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --pull always -p 8123:8123 -p 8463:8463 --name proton d.timeplus.com/timeplus-io/proton:latest
```

Please check [Server Ports](https://docs.timeplus.com/proton-ports) to determine which ports to expose, so that other tools can connect to Timeplus, such as DBeaver.

### Docker Compose:

The [Docker Compose stack](https://github.com/timeplus-io/proton/tree/develop/examples/ecommerce) demonstrates how to read/write data in Kafka/Redpanda with external streams.

### Timeplus Cloud:

Don't want to setup by yourself? Try Timeplus in [Cloud](https://demo.timeplus.cloud/)


### 🔎 Usage
SQL is the main interface. You can start a new terminal window with `proton client` to start the SQL shell.
> [!NOTE]
> You can also integrate Timeplus Proton with Python/Java/Go SDK, REST API, or BI plugins. Please check <a href="#-integrations"><strong>Integrations</strong></a>

In the `proton client`, you can write SQL to create [External Stream for Kafka](https://docs.timeplus.com/proton-kafka) or [External Table for ClickHouse](https://docs.timeplus.com/proton-clickhouse-external-table).

For example, you can read from AWS MSK and write the data to ClickHouse for the following SQL:

```sql
-- Read from AWS MSK using IAM Role
CREATE EXTERNAL STREAM aws_msk_stream (
  device string,
  temperature float
)
SETTINGS
    type='kafka',
    brokers='prefix.kafka.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:9098',
    topic='topic',
    security_protocol='SASL_SSL',
    sasl_mechanism='AWS_MSK_IAM';

-- Write to ClickHouse
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ch_aiven
SETTINGS type='clickhouse',
            address='abc.aivencloud.com:28851',
            user='avnadmin',
            password='..',
            secure=true,
            table='events';

-- Setup a long-running materialized view to write aggregated data to ClickHouse
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_msk2ch INTO ch_aiven AS
SELECT window_start as timestamp, device, avg(temperature) as avg_temperature
FROM tumble(aws_msk_stream, 10s) GROUP BY window_start, device;
```

If you don't have immediate access to Kafka or ClickHouse, you can also run the following SQL to generate random data:

```sql
-- Create a stream with random data
CREATE RANDOM STREAM devices(
  device string default 'device'||to_string(rand()%4),
  temperature float default rand()%1000/10);

-- Run the streaming SQL
SELECT device, count(*), min(temperature), max(temperature)
FROM devices GROUP BY device;
```

You should see data like the following:

```
┌─device──┬─count()─┬─min(temperature)─┬─max(temperature)─┐
│ device0 │    2256 │                0 │             99.6 │
│ device1 │    2260 │              0.1 │             99.7 │
│ device3 │    2259 │              0.3 │             99.9 │
│ device2 │    2225 │              0.2 │             99.8 │
└─────────┴─────────┴──────────────────┴──────────────────┘
```
